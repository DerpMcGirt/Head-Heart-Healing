        <div class="card-container">
            <p class="font-amatic-sc-bold">Denise is a compassionate and experienced therapist who brings a wealth of
                life experience to her practice. Having navigated various personal challenges, including marriage,
                parenting, divorce, and blended families, she understands the complexities of relationships and personal
                growth.</p>

            <p class="font-amatic-sc-bold">Denise has a positive outlook on life and values genuine conversations
                that build trust and therapeutic relationships.
                She has strong, supportive relationships with her adult children and their partners, and she
                discovered her true calling later in life, realizing her gift extends beyond making great appetizers
                for parties.</p>

            <p class="font-amatic-sc-bold">Denise loves to laugh and often uses humor as a coping mechanism. She
                enjoys learning about a wide range of topics and is spiritual, holding firm beliefs without imposing
                them on others.</p>

            <p class="font-amatic-sc-bold">In her sessions, Denise uses analogies and references from movies,
                books, music, and social media to connect with her clients. She focuses on building rapport and
                trust, allowing clients to express their thoughts and feelings openly. Denise helps clients
                explore their goals, whether they seek a different perspective, validation, or simply someone
                to listen.</p>
